these are the tasks you must do on a daily basis

• brush your teeth first thing in the morning, brew some coffee (with maybe 1-2 sugars), then hop on the PC
• do maybe a 20-30 minute thinking session do get your brain up and running. then start working on plaster

• do as many pushups & pullups in a single session as you can every thirty minutes (will add new exersises as i learn)
• drink (mostly) water, and consume healthy foods (that do not contain much grease or sugar)
• (always) go to sleep at 9:30 PM & attempt to wake up at around 7 - 7:30 AM (will be easier if you obtain a phone)

• brush your teeth right before you go to bed
• avoid masturbation as your sperm contains most of your energy, gross habit in the first place
• find ways around parent anger and avoid it as much as possible.

• avoid talking nonsense and talking trash about others. don't waste your energy, it's not worth it.
• get rid of any bad habits that you may have.
• be a hard worker and keep commiting towards your goals and projects on a daily basis.
